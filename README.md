## How To Use
Run targetsports.sh to scan targetsportsusa.com for 9mm and .22lr.

If you want to scan other calis of ammo, please go to the page of the cali;
for example,
  https://www.targetsportsusa.com/9mm-luger-ammo-c-51.aspx for 9mm;
and find a url of pattern 'ISearch.aspx?.....' in network traffic tab of the browser.
(I use Firefox with ctrl+I, and you will see "Network" tab.)
Put the URL in targetsports.py.
